## About

This portfolio marks the end of my two-year journey studying Front-End Development at Noroff. It showcases my growth in modern web technologies like React, Tailwind CSS, API integration, and component-based architecture.

Built with Astro and powered by Sanity.io, this project reflects my skills in both design and development â€” from creating a style guide in Figma to deploying a fully responsive, accessible, and real-world-ready application.
